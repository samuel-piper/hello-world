# hello-world
Used to store all my genius level ideas.  Notice that it is currently empty...
Well, I'm quite new at this code stuff, so hopefully this goes well.
I'm kind of wondering how long it will be before I start to get comfortable with all of this.
Hopefully it never does, because that will mean that I've learned everything I can, and that's not a good thing.
Wish me luck, inter-ethers.
